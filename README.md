# Major_project
Btech major project

The main purpose of this project is to make a comparison between different Alzheimer’s detection
methods. Amongst many different forms of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common one
and contributes to 60–70% of total cases. Screening of Alzheimer’s dementia is typically conducted
through paper-and-pencil cognitive tests. In this project we focused on comparison between
Spontaneous speech and MRI Image detection. This project is helpful to doctors and caretakers of
Alzheimer’s patients. As the detection of Alzheimer’s is costly machine learning technology will be
able to reduce the cost and time required to detection. It will also help in reducing the human errors
occurring during detection.
